**START PAVING YOUR WAY TO THE TOP!**

It’s no secret to the world that **_women_** are taking over the world day by day, step by step. It’s just a matter of time before we see them crawling their way until the top of the charts on every environment _– Politics, Fashion, Media Empire, Entertainment, Technology, Health, Social Movements_ – making history. 

Even though there is still a long way to go for the **_female_** population, they are making it hard for the world to ignore their messages. You go girl! 

According to the **Global Entrepreneurship Monitor** (which monitors 40 economies from around the world) globally, **_entrepreneurship_** rates among **_women_** increased by 13 percent versus 5 percent for men since 2012.  In a business environment dominated by males, the ability to access a woman role model with personal experience is a significant challenge.

Simply by doing what they love, and think they were born to do; all type of **_women_** worldwide are giving us a lesson on how to succeed on the market and make a difference in many people lives. 

Their secret? Hard work!

And today, we are bringing you a compilation of some of their secrets so you can start working on that **_entrepreneur_** attitude

<title-4>Be confident!<title-4>

That’s the number one rule and outfit to rock every day. Believe you can do it and you are most of the way there. Inside an **_entrepreneur_** world, there are no rules to follow, which is why it is important to maintain confidence and believe that the shaky ride is worth it because the world needs your impact. We need you! 

A determined woman is a woman who cannot be stopped.

<title-4>Big planes!<title-4>

This is your chance to dream big. Never underestimate your own potential and abilities. It is important to analyze the inner 
reason behind your business and really think about the legacy you want to leave behind. 

It is normal to feel a little bit scare at the beginning; but, if it doesn’t scare you, is not a big enough dream.

<title-4>Find support!<title-4>

Do not get trapped inside your own head trying to figure out how to do it. Look for information and support in other women who have similar goals to the ones that you set yourself.

<title-4>Failure is your friend!<title-4>

Do not get inside of your comfort zone!  Failure is an inevitable part of success, from which we learn. They are proof that you have taken the necessary risks on your journey. Often, **_women_** are more affected by the failure and let it affect their confidence. Don't let it!

<title-4>Be decisive!<title-4>

And there is no better example of determination than Malala Yousafzai. She is known for human rights advocacy, especially the education of women and children in her native Swat Valley in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa; where the local Taliban had at times banned girls from attending school. In 2017 Malala started her university education in Oxford. 

Fight for what you want. You are your own judge.

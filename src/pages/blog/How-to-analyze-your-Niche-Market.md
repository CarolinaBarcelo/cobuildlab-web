To build your businesses and change your life and others lives trough the products or services you are providing, you need to be able to connect with your customers and let them know how you can help them. 

<br/>

When you are an entrepreneur, is almost impossible to get in touch and fulfill other’s needs if you can’t communicate with them. Let’s say you are trying to talk to someone who doesn’t understand your language. That could be the same picture if you start to sell your products or services to the wrong person, to the wrong market. Consequently, it is all up to learning about growth. 

<br/>

A Niche Market means, where your product or services belongs in the industry related and where your customers are -demographics that is intended to impact-. But more than that, by defining your niche market you will also know, the product features aimed at satisfying specific market needs, as well as the price range and production quality. It will tell you the specific market segment that you can conquer. 

<br/>

Every single product can be defined by its market niche. The niche market is extremely specialized and aiming to survive among the competition from numerous super companies. Even the established ones create products for different niches, for example, a software company has accounting or tax solution targeted for the individual taxpayer or families niche while at the same time having separate solutions with one of these functions for small or big businesses. 

<br/>

In order to growth markets even before you start, define the final product quality (low or high) not depending on the price elasticity of demand, but the specific needs that the product is aimed to satisfy and, in some cases, aspects of brand recognition (e.g. prestige, practicability, money saving, expensiveness, environmental conscience, or social status). 

<br/>

With that being said, you will realize that your competition already has been working with your niche market and they are a good place to look for answers and numbers, also nowadays social media channels have tons of tools that offer to their business account holders the best way to analyze their “buyer persona” with a fully detail demographic picture of them.

## <span style="color: #264a60;">Cobuilding</span>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #000000;">Is the process of transforming an idea in a sustainable business, through the combination and collaboration of the areas of Lean Entrepreneurship, Business Strategy, Technological Innovation and Exponential Growth</span>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <em><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #000000;">4Geeks divides the cobuilding process in 4 phases:</span></strong></em>

&nbsp;

Don’t offer what people doesn’t want. The purpose of this phase is to validate that your idea is aiming a problem that actually exists; Along with that, that the solution is something doable.

&nbsp;

##### **Step 1: Idea Validation: Technical and Economical**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This step we consult with experts on the company about the feasibility of the solution to be build. This quick analysis would reveal basically two things: </span>**The idea is built** **in a reasonable amount of time (1 &#8211; 6 months) with a reasonable amount of money**<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this step is also important to write the specs to any </span>**Proof of Concept** <span style="font-weight: 400;">needed in the next Phase. A Proof of Concept, is indeed a proof that the idea can be built, usually use for mitigating any doubts from the technical perspective and gain stakeholders support.</span>

&nbsp;

##### **Step 2: Market Validation: Estimation and Competitors Analysis**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Market validation is the way to confirm that your idea is a solution to a problem people actually have. Is this step and before building anything we</span> **close test your idea** <span style="font-weight: 400;">with a small group inside the company to get an honest feedback.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this same step we take the time to build the first </span>**Customer Archetype**<span style="font-weight: 400;">, defining some aspects of our Market Audience: Age Range, Income, Work Sector, Job Titles, suffer from the problem we are trying to solve, how is the best to find them and how can we expose the product to them.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time we start </span>**researching your competitors** <span style="font-weight: 400;">investigating ways in which the problem was solve before, their weakness and their power points, also how this solutions get to market and how well they are doing SEO.</span>

&nbsp;

##### **Step 3: Value and Growth Hypothesis**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once we had established ground, we build our first version of our Startup Hypothesis:</span>

<li style="list-style-type: none;">
  <ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;">
      <b>Value Hypothesis</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: We write down how our idea will provide value for those who are willing to use it.</span>
    </li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;">
      <b>Growth Hypothesis:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Once we got the point in which we are actually providing value, we write down the ways we can massively reach potential customers.</span>
    </li>
  </ul>
</li>

##### 

##### **Step 1: Prototyping**

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the initial stage of transforming the product into a product we need to start with a </span>**prototype**<span style="font-weight: 400;">. A prototype, depending of the case can have none, one or some of the functionality that the final product will have, enough to been available to present and explain: </span>**how the product is going to work, how it can look like and how the user is gonna use it.**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A software product will at least include </span>**Wireframes, User Stories and minimum set of features**<span style="font-weight: 400;">, and in other cases may include and is not limited to: Hardware interaction, Materials look and feels, etc.</span>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

##### **Step 2: Customers Archetypes**

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once we have a prototype around the table, it’s time to </span>**review the first version of the Customer Archetype.**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point we have enough information about the market and the product to lain down the </span>**2nd version** <span style="font-weight: 400;">reviewing the initial demographic y making the necessary adjustments.</span>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

##### **Step 3: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**

&nbsp;

_**It’s time to build!.**_

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this step we start building the product using </span>**agile techniques and early retrospective.** <span style="font-weight: 400;">The average time to have the first functional version is a month, and since that moment every week new functionality is added or tested.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Having an early feedback of the product is very important in this Step. It is also important to remember that, maybe not all of the features discussed in the prototype have to be include it in the MVP, as its main goal is to have enough to test the </span>**Value Hypothesis**<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

##### **Step 4: Live testing**

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One the most important thing about building and idea is to have tested as soon as it’s testable. This can occur even if the MVP is not fully featured.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The main goal here is to find a group of </span>**potential customers and start rolling out the product**<span style="font-weight: 400;">. This can be coworkers, stakeholders, family, close friends, suppliers, so on.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most important part here is to get and honest a usable feedback by conducting interviews to this customers to really know about the impact on the product.</span>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

##### **Step 5: A/B Testing**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a critical step that depends a lot of the result of the previous activities. You have the MVP, the results of the tests, and now what?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually if the product is generally criticized and qualified as not satisfying the need, well it&#8217;s an easy decision to make, just head back to step one, with the information and start the prototype again. Also this decision comes very easy if the product is broadly accepted, you need to move on to the next step as quickly as possible</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The real challenge here is probably having around a 30-40% of acceptance, it’s a critical choice to decide whether to move on with the product or head back to the prototyping step. There is no formula or rules that applies here because many things can happen, we selected the wrong audience, we didn’t provide an MVP reflecting the value hypothesis, the product is slow or not complete yet. So, the best way to take here should be  review carefully the feedback from the Live Test along with the stakeholders and all members of the group,  and and make the call: </span>

&nbsp;

  * **Get the feedback and head back to step 1 (Prototyping)**

  * Change the test group and re do the Live Testing to validate the current feedback

  * Tweak the MVP according to the  feedback and re do the Live Testing. (Minimum changes)

  * Add or remove some features of the MVP according to feedback obtain. This is A/B testing

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A/B testing allow you to split the testing groups into subgroups for testing features that feel misused, unnecessary or that they are missing from the original MVP.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no short way here, prepare the team for test, the customers group, and we star testing as soon as possible.</span>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

##### **Step 6: Product Market Fit**

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point we have a product that solves a problem, that works and that customers like. So we have validated or Value Hypothesis.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This steps include an equality important step, to validate our Product Market Fit.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Product Market Fit refers to the segment of customers who are willing to pay for the solution that we are providing in terms of: </span>**How much, how often and how many are willing to do it.** 

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our initial test group is a very important source of information on this, so this are the ones who we interrogate first, moving on to a some real world potential customers or some early adopters. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The results of this Step should provide the projections necessary to easily know how much money is envolve in the life of our startup. </span>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

##### **Step 7: Value and Growth Hypothesis (Again)**

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the product in hand, the information provided by the test and our different surveys, we </span>**review our hypothesis** <span style="font-weight: 400;">and shape it again with the new data.</span>\[/vc\_column\_text\]\[/vc\_tta\_section\]\[vc\_tta\_section title=&#8221;Phase 3: Close the Circle&#8221; tab\_id=&#8221;1513209932281-a7804151-33b4&#8243; add\_icon=&#8221;true&#8221; i\_icon\_dfd\_icons=&#8221;dfd-socicon-layers&#8221;\]\[dfd\_spacer screen\_wide\_spacer\_size=&#8221;25&#8243; screen\_normal\_resolution=&#8221;1024&#8243; screen\_tablet\_resolution=&#8221;800&#8243; screen\_mobile\_resolution=&#8221;480&#8243;\][vc\_column_text]

##### 

<span style="font-weight: 400;">A very important step. Here we make sure that the idea has every detail that is needed for been available to transform effectively: Identity, purpose, values, and the correct tools for launching are the main purpose of this step. </span>

&nbsp;

##### **Step 1: Branding:**

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The soul of the product would be the perfect way to put it. Through a</span> **Brand Book** <span style="font-weight: 400;">we specify the looks and feel of the Brand, the icons, the colors, identity, purpose, values, forms and meaning for the Brand to be available to differentiate from the rest out there</span>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

##### **Step 2: WebSite and Social Networks**

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nowadays the web presence is as important as anything else, we complete the resources for the initial marketing campaign with the support of the Brand identity. </span>**We build the website, create the marketing channels in the internet and we set them ready for start**<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

##### **Step 3: Strategy**

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we have almost all the tools needed and required for any business to succeed, we have and idea, a product, a Brand, now what? We need to proper way to combine all those elements to succeed effectively. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Prior to launch a</span> **Business and Marketing Strategy** <span style="font-weight: 400;">are need it to know the way in which we are gonna manage the startup and the way the product must be put it in the hands of customers.</span>\[/vc\_column\_text\]\[/vc\_tta\_section\]\[vc\_tta\_section title=&#8221;Phase 4: Acceleration&#8221; tab\_id=&#8221;1513210226702-8a17165c-f67a&#8221; add\_icon=&#8221;true&#8221; i\_icon\_dfd\_icons=&#8221;dfd-socicon-slideshare&#8221;\]\[dfd\_spacer screen\_wide\_spacer\_size=&#8221;25&#8243; screen\_normal\_resolution=&#8221;1024&#8243; screen\_tablet\_resolution=&#8221;800&#8243; screen\_mobile\_resolution=&#8221;480&#8243;\][vc\_column_text]

##### <span style="font-weight: 400; color: #264a60;"><em><strong>Congratulations!</strong></em> </span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We have proved to bu a sustainable business with a healthy growth rate. It’s time to accelerate.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At this point our business strategy and marketing strategy must be on the right track, so it’s time to create a High Impact.</span>

&nbsp;

##### **Step 1:Growth Hacking: Short-Term Exponential Growth**

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Growth Hacking stands as the most effective way of finding the quickest channel of sustainable growth for a startup.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is no rules in what to do here beyond </span>**consulting** <span style="font-weight: 400;">with experts in the field and start testing ways for achieving the necessary growth to take the business to next step.</span>\[/vc\_column\_text\]\[/vc\_tta\_section\]\[/dfd\_tta\_tour\]\[/vc\_column\]\[/vc\_row\]\[vc\_row dfd\_row\_config=&#8221;full\_width\_content&#8221;\]\[vc\_column\]\[dfd\_spacer screen\_wide\_spacer\_size=&#8221;100&#8243; screen\_normal\_resolution=&#8221;1024&#8243; screen\_tablet\_resolution=&#8221;800&#8243; screen\_mobile\_resolution=&#8221;480&#8243;\]\[dfd\_call\_to\_action module\_animation=&#8221;transition.flipYIn&#8221; ic\_dfd\_icons=&#8221;dfd-socicon-mail&#8221; icon\_size=&#8221;40&#8243; block\_title=&#8221;Need more information&#8221; block\_subtitle=&#8221;Focused on optimizing the transformation of ideas into profitable businesses.&#8221; button\_text=&#8221;Write us!&#8221; button\_link=&#8221;url:https%3A%2F%2Fcobuild.4geeks.co%2F%23contactus|||&#8221; horizontal\_padding=&#8221;35&#8243; vertical\_padding=&#8221;35&#8243; main\_border\_radius=&#8221;6&#8243; main\_style=&#8221;style-1&#8243; tutorials=&#8221;&#8221; show\_icon=&#8221;enable\_icon&#8221; undefined=&#8221;&#8221; title\_font\_options=&#8221;tag:div&#8221; subtitle\_font\_options=&#8221;tag:div&#8221;\]\[/vc\_column\][/vc\_row]

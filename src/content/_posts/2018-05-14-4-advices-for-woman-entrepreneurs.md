**By: Roxana Alastre**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Rising as a </span>**Woman Entrepreneur** <span style="font-weight: 400;">can bring tough times to your life, especially when you&#8217;re picking the </span>**leadership** <span style="font-weight: 400;">and business role over the socially forced gender roles as wife and mother.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But as a soothing response to that, you can have the certainty that you&#8217;re not the first one to handle these situations and you surely won&#8217;t be the last, so it is very important to keep a few things in mind if you’re starting your path as </span>**Woman Entrepreneur:**

  * **Join to support groups**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s very difficult to work alone, finding women around the world who can share their experience and process with you will be a great upholder. Also creating women&#8217;s support groups will be an amazing experience for you, in that way many women can share their ideas, goals and even frustrations.</span>

**Associations**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are a lot of great associations like the </span>**American Business Women&#8217;s Association (ABWA)** <span style="font-weight: 400;">where you can surely find good resources and supportive people who will be very happy to help you.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning from the success and failures of others can increase your growth massively, that&#8217;s why sharing experiences are so important when it comes to </span>**entrepreneurs.**

**Online help**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span>**Entrepreneur.com** <span style="font-weight: 400;">blog periodically offers articles with inspiring stories of </span>**Women** <span style="font-weight: 400;">(and Men) </span>**Entrepreneurs** <span style="font-weight: 400;">from around the world, you can check it out anytime you need something to inspire you.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The site </span>**startups.co.uk** <span style="font-weight: 400;">has an online list of support groups and resources only for </span>**female entrepreneurs** <span style="font-weight: 400;">in the UK and around the world, it&#8217;s a very useful resource when you are at the beginning of a </span>**startup**<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even </span>**Forbes.com** <span style="font-weight: 400;">did a recent article about Alice, &#8220;The Siri for </span>**female entrepreneurs**<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;, a platform that uses </span>**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** <span style="font-weight: 400;">to help women </span>**entrepreneurs** <span style="font-weight: 400;">connect with other </span>**business growing people, funders, investors, and resources**<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You really have a lot of sources on the web so there&#8217;s no excuse to feel alone during this process.</span>

  * **Be conscious about sexism but don’t allow it to be your anchor**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You must be ready to feel underappreciated, especially when it comes to technology or sports </span>**start-ups** <span style="font-weight: 400;">that were dominated only by men. Awful and sexist comments could come when you are rising the top or try to collect investors for your business, but those are situations when you have to speak it out and overcome it.</span>

**Let’s talk about testimonials and quantities**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although sexism may not always be so outstanding, it can be present in little things. And it&#8217;s Heather Marie case, she is a founder and CEO of </span>**Shoppable**<span style="font-weight: 400;">, an e-commerce platform, she tells the story about a meeting where she asked the investor if he had seen the background on her company, he told her &#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t. Actually, I&#8217;ve got to be honest with you. I didn&#8217;t look into at it at all. I just took the meeting because you&#8217;re hot.&#8221; Of course, Marie ended the meeting quickly.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Diverse cases as Marie&#8217;s are described in </span>**Thecut.com** <span style="font-weight: 400;">in an amazing article who describe every aspect of sexism in </span>**Silicon Valley**<span style="font-weight: 400;">. They even describe how wider is the gap with black female founders who make up point two percent (.</span>**2%**<span style="font-weight: 400;">) of all venture funding according to a recent study that also shows up that &#8220;more than </span>**60.000 start-ups** <span style="font-weight: 400;">found that only 88 had </span>**back female founders**<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;. It also says that &#8220;Black-female-founded </span>**start-ups** <span style="font-weight: 400;">raised an average of </span>**$36.000**<span style="font-weight: 400;">, while the white-male-led </span>**start-ups** <span style="font-weight: 400;">that </span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">failed</span>_ <span style="font-weight: 400;">raised an average of </span>**$1.3 million**<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In other hand, the </span>**Women Owned Businesses’ Report** <span style="font-weight: 400;">shows a big </span>**growth** <span style="font-weight: 400;">for businesses owned by women of color between the years 2007 and 2016, which can translate into a shortening in the gap of racism and sexism on </span>**start-up** <span style="font-weight: 400;">businesses.</span>

**To fight against sexism**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, there are very big chances of not having to deal with this kind of treatment in every opportunity, in that order, you cannot allow yourself to become a princess in danger if you chose this path is necessary to overcome every obstacle with </span>**strength** <span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span>**braveness.**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The sexism surely exists but that doesn’t have to hold you back even a little. </span>

&nbsp;

  * **Be confident**

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Confidence is the key to success, being confident is a very good way to show how much you trust in your project without having to say anything about it. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can find a lot of online tools to help you to get through self-confidence issues and to improve your body language so it’s absolute best. If you have problems with presenting at meetings, joining online sites as </span>**Toastmasters.com** <span style="font-weight: 400;">could help you to improve your speaking and leadership skills with conversational clubs.</span>

**Become an expert**

**Having all the knowledge** <span style="font-weight: 400;">around your </span>**start-up** <span style="font-weight: 400;">and your </span>**vision clarified** <span style="font-weight: 400;">before starting a presentation can instantly boost your </span>**reliability**<span style="font-weight: 400;">. Deep investigation on your niche is completely necessary in order to become an expert, wondering about what you would ask if you were watching your presentation is also a very good way to be prepared for incoming questions.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are up to make some online appearances in blogs or even answering comments, you have to project the most professional image possible, remember that you are the face of your business but must show that you are also the brain.</span>

  * **Follow your passion** 

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You shouldn&#8217;t start any business unless you will be doing something you are really good at or you’re absolutely up to learn and innovate for the next years. That’s why the best tip is to find something you </span>**really enjoy** <span style="font-weight: 400;">and are willing to </span>**stick with it** <span style="font-weight: 400;">forever and over everything. In that way, you’ll be able to overcome every situation for your business.</span>

**On a final note**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re really thinking about starting as an entrepreneur you must know that over </span>**30% of all US businesses are majority female owned**<span style="font-weight: 400;">, and what is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">even wonderful is that this number continues to grow at twice the rate of all US firms, and they are </span>**increasing** <span style="font-weight: 400;">over the years.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span>**Womenable and American Express OPEN** <span style="font-weight: 400;">took a look at the state of women-owned businesses across the U.S in the past years and in these charts you can really appreciate the huge growth between 2007 and 2016. Based on that we can assume that this will continue growing over the years and we are not so far from business parity.</span>

  <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Snapchat isn&#8217;t about capturing the Kodak moment. It&#8217;s about communicating with the full range of human emotion, not just what appears to be pretty of perfect&#8221; </span></span>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">– Snapchat’s CEO, Evan Spiegel</span></span>
</p>

<span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"> </span>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine a space where everything you post vanishes in a matter of hours. Nothing can be tracked, you have notifications if someone screenshot one of your selfies, it is impossible to keep metrics on the number of people following you or viewing your posts, etc. Critics looked at this as the certain formula of failure but against any possibility: this was the </span><b>Snapchat&#8217;s</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> appeal.</span></span>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a world where we are used to live with eternal stresses caused by the longevity of personal information posted online and not being able later to take it down, the ephemeral nature of </span><b>Snapchat</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> allows its audience to feel free to express whatever they want inscribed in stone. </span></span>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the beginning no one could possible imagine the amount of success of </span><b>Snapchat</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The app was originally launched on 2011 and by May 2012, 25 images were being sent per second, by November users have shared over one billion photos over </span><b>Snapchat</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, according to its published statistics. </span></span>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><b>growth </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">of the </span><b>startup</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is irrefutable, by 2016 the company raised $1.81 billion in equity offering, the company reported in a U.S regulatory filing in the mentioned year, translating into strong investor interest on it. </span></span>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 160 million of people use it in a daily basis to connect with their friends and explore curated content from top publishers, </span><b>Snapchat</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> had built a very strong community, reaching 45% of all 18 to 24 years old social media users in the US, according to eMarketer.</span></span>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><b>The developing</b></span>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><b><i>The Stories about the Discover of marketing chances</i></b></span>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the introduction of </span><b>Snapchat</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Stories that made every major brand to turn their looks to the Snap’s appeal, they saw in the 24 hours lasting content the potential </span><b>growth</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their own companies. Stories are the compilation of snaps that relate to certain topic or event.</span></span>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The opportunity for major media companies came with the activation of Discovery, where content developers like BuzzFeed, Vanity Fair, National Geographic, were able to provide high quality videos for </span><b>Snapchat </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">younger users whom doesn’t consume their contents in a daily basis.</span></span>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">

A very good example of this was the </span><b>Taco Bell</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> experience during the 2017 </span><b>Super Bowl</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they launched a new item, the Quesalupa, in their menu over a </span><b>Snapchat</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> campaign and it resulted in more than 40.000 pre-orders of the product.</span></span>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The success of </span><b>Snapchat</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was also built by celebrity influencers that attracted their audience to the app, their founders understood the concept on </span><b>niche-focused platforms</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and they gave to Millennials what they loved the most: the possibility of entering through candid shots at someone else’s life.</span></span>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s how the whole concept of </span><b>Snapchat</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> influencers came to life, we saw every snap as the window to the personal life of a celebrity, and they talked to us in their beds and even gave out little advices of what famous or not-so-famous product we should buy. </span></span>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Influencers became the </span><b>messengers for branded content</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, maintaining close relationships with a community of followers and even </span><b>co-creating content featuring brand-related topics and products</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></span>

  <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><b>The plummet</b></span>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">

<p style="text-align: left;">

</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">Millennials hated the new layout, contradicting with the company intentions they found it “confusing” and “over complicated”. The update is trying to keep friends and professional content separate.</span>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">According to the founder Spiegel, “separating social from media has allowed us to build the best way to communicate with friends and the best way to watch great content”. They included a new algorithm that is supposed to eventually bring more personalized content higher up on the Discover page to its users.</span>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><b><i>The legacy of influencers</i></b></span>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“sooo does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore? Or is it just me… ugh, this is so sad.” With a single tweet the most famous Snap celebrity Kylie Jenner knocked $1.3 billion off company’s market value, according to </span><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2018/02/22/technology/snapchat-update-kylie-jenner/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNNMoney</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></span>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;">But is Snapchat listening? Everything says: they’re not. And for even worse news, many sources says that they’re planning to introduce some changes that might make you loathe it a little less.</span>

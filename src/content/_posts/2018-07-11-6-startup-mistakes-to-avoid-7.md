## <span id="1_Workers_having_technical_skills_are_in_high_demand"><span style="font-family: lato; font-size: 18pt;"><b>#1 Workers having technical skills are in high demand</b></span></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">We are in the 21st century, and it is an internet age. Consequently, virtually everything has gone digital. Companies need someone to help them keep up with the pace of technological demands hence their demand for individuals with versed technological knowledge, both in the software and hardware aspects of their technological needs.  It is unfortunate that the number of people who possess coding skills required for business advancement is low, which makes coding a money-spinning profession for anyone that has the skill. </span>

## <span id="2_It_requires_no_college_degree"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: lato;"><b>#2 It requires no college degree</b></span></span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You do not need to have a degree in computer science before you can become a professional coder. It is not rocket science; so, it can be learned very easily. I have come across Economics graduates that have made a lot of money from coding after acquiring the required skills. Anyone can make a switch from any profession into computer programming, even from non-science-related fields. The skill of coding can transform you into a professional in </span><a href="http://progostech.com/ecommerce-development/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ecommerce development</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in no time.</span></span>

## <span id="3_The_pay_and_benefits_are_good"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: lato;"><b>#3 The pay and benefits are good</b></span></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">Working as a techie is high-paying. The average annual pay of a computer programmer was $79,530 as far back as 2015, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, an integral part of the United States Department of Labor. The average annual pay is far ahead of that of the general household income in the United States, which was just $53,657 as at 2014. Many web development companies will gladly employ a computer programmer, either for online or offline jobs.  </span>

## <span id="4_The_skills_are_for_life"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: lato;"><b>#4 The skills are for life</b></span></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">You will always have the coding skills with you for life once you have acquired them. Companies will value you for the time you spend, and you will always earn for the rest of your life. Coding skills never leave you even in old age, and you will be valued for life since the high demand for coding skill will outlive you. </span>

## <span id="5_The_power_to_create"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: lato;"><b>#5 The power to create </b></span></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">Coding skills will no doubt give you the power to create. However, what you can create will depend on the particular coding skill that you have acquired. Coding will give you the ability to create mobile applications, web applications and even build a website.  Aside from making money from others, you can also create something for yourself. </span>

## <span id="6_Understanding_how_things_are_made"><span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: lato;"><b>#6 Understanding how things are made</b></span></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">Coding skill will translate you from the world of an ordinary end user to the world of a technician that knows the secret behind those technologies. Never again will you get confused about programs or applications you can always find a way around them when they want to prove problematic.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning coding will translate you from the level of an ordinary technology end user to the level of true professionals. You can partner with a </span><a href="http://progostech.com/web-development/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">web development company</span></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in your locality for helpful guidance on coding skills.      </span></span>

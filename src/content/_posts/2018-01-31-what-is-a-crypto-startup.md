Generally used to cover the major features and topics of developing and using cryptography technologies: Startups: a business that is in the first stage of its set-ups.</span>

> <span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;"><em>“A startup is a company working to solve a problem where the solution is not obvious and success is not guaranteed”</em> &#8211; Neil Blumentha</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;"><strong>Startups Beginnings</strong></span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">Now that the simplest part to understand and comprehend is out of the picture, let&#8217;s talk a bit more about how these microorganisms work today</span>.In <span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">the late 1990´s, the most common type of STARTUPS Company was a “Dotcom”, branded by a quick rise in fairness markets fueled by investments in Internet-based companies. The value of equity markets grew exponentially, rising from under 1,000 to more than 5,000 between 1995 and 2000, according to www.investopedia.com</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">Unluckily, most of these internet startups eventually went ruined due to major mistakes in their rudimentary business plans, such as a lack of sustainable revenue. Nonetheless, there were a few internet startups that did survive when the “dotcom bubble” burst. Examples of such companies are bookseller Amazon.com and internet auction portal eBay </span>are<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">Nowadays, companies are seeing as a supreme investment and growth “Crypto Startups”. While much new business is being worked on by the largest tech companies, cryptocurrency remains as one of the largest non-corporate startup opportunities.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;"><strong>Why is cryptocurrency one of the best startups opportunities?</strong></span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">Well, most people tend to argue about how expensive fees charged by any financial institutions can be. An avoiding them is one of the appealing characteristics why everybody is choosing to with cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies make it informal to transfer funds between two parties in a transaction and funds transfers are done with minimal handling fees, allowing users to avoid the unreasonable fees charged by most banks and financial institutions for flex transfers; which are facilitated through the use of public and private sources for security purposes.  But, if you are avoiding crazy fees, be aware that Cryptocurrencies are not immune to the threat of hacking. That’s why a digital cryptocurrency balance can be wiped out by a computer crash if a backup copy of the holdings does not exist.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;"><strong>Why joining a Cryptocurrency Startup?</strong></span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">If you have previous experience in the field and know some of the terminologies inside the cryptocurrency world; here some of the reasons why you should join a Cryptocurrency Startup:</span>

  * <span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">Remote Flexibility: Adjustable work policies where you are only required to be at the office on certain days. Which can give you the opportunity to have more than one job?</span>
  * <span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">Better Incomes: One of the perks of cryptocurrency companies is profit-sharing arrangements. And beating the industry regular salaries by about 10-20.</span>

> <span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;"><em>“Cryptocurrency employees are more likely to enjoy distributed working arrangements and are geographically disperse compared to traditional candidates. It’s interesting that within companies that focus on distributed technology the candidates are also so distributed”</em> &#8211; Matt at The Picks & Shovels Co</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">Employee Liquidity: Only really applies to new coin companies. From an equity perspective, employees get the liquidity benefits of working at a public company with the high upside potential of working at a startup.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">If you are considering “Startups” as a new way of investment for you, remember that first, you need to invest time and money into market research, which helps to determine the demand of a product or service. A startup requires a comprehensive business plan outlining </span>mission <span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">statement, upcoming visions, and goals as well as administration and marketing strategies.</span>
  
<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">From what you have read so far, what is your opinion on the “Crypto Startup” world?</span>

<span style="font-family: lato; font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt;">When you are an entrepreneur, is almost impossible to get in touch and fulfill other’s needs if you can’t communicate with them. Let’s say you are trying to talk to someone who doesn’t understand your language. That could be the same picture if you start to sell your products or services to the wrong person, to the wrong market. Consequently, it is all up to learning about growth.</span>

<span style="font-family: lato; font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt;">A Niche Market means, where your product or services belongs in the industry related and where your customers are -demographics that is intended to impact-. But more than that, by defining your niche market you will also know, the product features aimed at satisfying specific market needs, as well as the price range and production quality. It will tell you the specific market segment that you can conquer. </span>

<span style="font-family: lato; font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt;">Every single product can be defined by its market niche. The niche market is extremely specialized and aiming to survive among the competition from numerous super companies. Even the established ones create products for different niches, for example, a software company has accounting or tax solution targeted for the individual taxpayer or families niche while at the same time having separate solutions with one of these functions for small or big businesses.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: lato; font-weight: 400;">In order to </span><span style="font-family: lato; font-weight: 400;">growth markets even before you start, define t</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he final product quality (low or high) not depending on the price elasticity of demand, but the specific needs that the product is aimed to satisfy and, in some cases, aspects of brand recognition (e.g. prestige, practicability, money saving, expensiveness, environmental conscience, or social status).</span></span>

<span style="font-family: lato; font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt;">With that being said, you will realize that your competition already has been working with your niche market and they are a good place to look for answers and numbers, also nowadays social media channels have tons of tools that offer to their business account holders the best way to analyze their “buyer persona” with a fully detail demographic picture of them.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>Top Hacks to identify your Niche Market:</b></span>

  1. <span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>Build a list of your Top 10 Competitors and make sure that you have all their social media profiles</b><span style="font-family: lato; font-weight: 400;">. Use for searching them: Google, Facebook groups, Forums, Quora, Blogs or even for more details there are Marketing Firms or Research and Business Intelligence Software.</span></span>
  2. <span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>Use a tool to see their metrics and obtain more data about their sites.</b><span style="font-family: lato; font-weight: 400;"> Having your competitor’s websites, you can find more info like: global rank, category they are registered on the internet classification, monthly visits, traffic sources, top organic keywords, top paid keywords, social network sources, audience interests, similar websites, and related mobile apps.</span></span>

Whether if you are selling a product or giving a service, someone needs and wants that. For each competitor and for yourself, identify which problem you are solving and how are you explaining this solution to the person who needs it.</span></span>
</li>
<li style="font-family: lato; font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-size: 14pt;"><b>Social Media conversation: </b><span style="font-family: lato; font-weight: 400;">once you started listening the social media conversation related to your industry and your product you will be able to identify:</span></span>
</li>

  * <span style="font-family: lato; font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt;">Location:</span> <span style="font-family: lato; font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt;">Reach people in areas where you want to do business. You can even create a radius around a store to help create more walk-ins.</span>
  * <span style="font-family: lato; font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt;">Interests: Find people based on what they’re into, like hobbies, favorite entertainment and more.</span>
  * <span style="font-family: lato; font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt;">Behaviors: Reach people based on their purchase behaviors, device usage and other activities.</span>

<span style="font-family: lato; font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt;">Trends, trends and more trends.</span>

<span style="font-family: lato; font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt;">Finally, you will like to have an eye open in the products that are top selling across your industry and your niche market, now that you know it. And again, for that, a little bit of researching will give you a strong and reliable foundation to make your business growth and take it to the next level.</span>

<span style="font-family: lato; font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt;">One of the biggest hack is building a community around people’s shared interest in an unordinary product. It’s better if you, as a seller, are passionate about the specific product or have expert knowledge of it. This would make it easier for you to create a following.</span>

<span style="font-family: lato; font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt;">Market trends tend to be heavily influenced by consumer habits and behaviors. By carrying out the following types of industry trend analysis you’ll be able to determine the moves that could have a direct impact on your overall business performance:</span>

<li style="font-family: lato; font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-family: lato; font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt;">Keep track of industry influencers and publications</span>
</li>
<li style="font-family: lato; font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-family: lato; font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt;">Know the up-to-date industry research and trends reports. </span>
</li>
<li style="font-family: lato; font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-family: lato; font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt;">Make the most of digital tools and analytics about your market behavior.</span>
</li>
<li style="font-family: lato; font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-family: lato; font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt;">Monitoring the prices and tariffs.</span>

<li style="font-family: lato; font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-family: lato; font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt;">Listen to your customers.</span>
</li>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt;">Don’t forget that even if you do this starting your business, as the demand of products are changing daily and monthly depending on your target market, you will keep going back to this process from time to time.</span>

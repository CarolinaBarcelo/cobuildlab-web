The writers of books and novels are experts in hooking their readers. Today, every entrepreneur wants to tell stories, but we ask when and why did Storytelling become so much desirable, so important and so effective to sell products and services.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">Be an entrepreneur in these days means that you have to know too many things, not only about your area but also you must know about <strong>planning</strong>, <strong>strategies</strong>, <strong>management</strong> and <strong>marketing</strong>. In this last point, you have to know how to offer your product or service to your customers, investors, collaborators and employees. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">Here is when the Storytelling becomes important in business. Recently, all the big companies, brands and startups are coming to use the storytelling to get their customers, capture the attention and be interested in buying the product/service. But, what is Storytelling?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">According to <strong>Kay Fabella</strong>, a storyteller, it is the art of telling a story using sensorial language that let the audience internalize, understand and create personal meaning for it. When you tell a story for your costumer, you can connect with her/him emotions, memories, sensations in such a way that they want to buy whatever that you are offering to them. </span>

## <span id="8211_When_do_we_use_the_Storytelling"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;"><b>&#8211; When do we use the Storytelling?</b></span></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">You can use the Storytelling in different scenarios. When you have to talk with your investors, you can do it through a story. <strong>Donna Griffit</strong>, another greatest storyteller, says that they are looking 3 things always:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">&#8211; <strong>Credibility</strong></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">&#8211; <strong>Likeability</strong></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">&#8211; <strong>Momentum</strong></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">So, you have to think and create a story of your company or your beginnings with creativity, that must be credible and simple, to earn their trust, that can evoke emotions, like as happiness, sadness, enthusiasm, excitement. And finally, you have to talk about your numbers, your growth and where do you want to go.</span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Photo: In a meeting with your investors, collaborators or employees you can use a storytelling that makes them feel some emotions. Photo by rawpixel on Unsplash</span></i></span>

&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">Also, you can use a storytelling to sell to your customers, but in some way that they do not realize you are selling, that is the most difficult. </span>

## <span id="How_can_you_give_form_to_your_story"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;"><b>How can you give form to your story?</b></span></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">Donna Griffit says that the startup’s stories or brands stories have 4 parts:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">&#8211; Highlights some problem, challenge or need that you think that may have the audience. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">&#8211; Give a solution to the problem.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">&#8211; The business that can handle it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">&#8211; Moving forward and next steps.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">All of these things have to be related to the client’s need and not ours. We have to put our product or service in the middle of the story, but is the client the protagonist. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">Now, think about in all the movies, tv series, novel books, talk shows and others social media stories could catch you because they empathize with you.</span>

&nbsp;

## <span id="Good_examples_of_Storytelling"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;"><b>Good examples of Storytelling</b></span></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">Do you have afraid? Do you not know where to start? So, we give you some examples of good practices of Storytelling that can help you and give you some ideas to begin. </span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;"><b>The Líbero magazine</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a football publication that launched a campaign to connect daily situations with football, and in this way empathize with their readers. The message of the video series was “If they explain it to you with football, you understand”. Let you the link of the full video: </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vDJMs8_dMA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vDJMs8_dMA</span></a></span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;"><b>Google</b> <b>India</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> created a video that promotes searches on its platform through a story of two friends who has not seen each other for years. The objective is to show how Google can find you whatever you want through the Google Search. Here you can see it: </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWUjoE_lPps&list=PLA1xw_kpTN0GOIhQJ0mZtwsketY20mD5i&index=3"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWUjoE_lPps&list=PLA1xw_kpTN0GOIhQJ0mZtwsketY20mD5i&index=3</span></a></span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;"><b>Airbnb</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a company and platform of software dedicated to offering lodging, experiences and restaurants to tourist and own. Every post that they do on Instagram is a little story that hooks up and leaves you wanting more to know. </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BjuxlwagAlB/?taken-by=airbnb"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.instagram.com/p/BjuxlwagAlB/?taken-by=airbnb</span></a></span>

<span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some people that have the Storytelling in their blood. </span><b>Steve Jobs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was a native storyteller; in his conferences or speeches, he had the formula of a story to thrill, excite and convince his audience. Including their products were not described by their characteristics or compositions; he presented them always with a story, explaining the benefits. The most representative example of this is the iPod. He did not say to us: It has 1 GB of memory. He said: “In it, you can have 1.000 songs”. This is one of the more emotive speeches that he said: </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1R-jKKp3NA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1R-jKKp3NA</span></a></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 14pt; font-family: lato;">Like them exists some many companies, brands, startup’s and entrepreneurs practicing the Storytelling, so you can do it too ¡Go for it! </span>
